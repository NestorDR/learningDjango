## Description

This example is my implementation of the concepts explained in the first part of the [Django Course (in Spanish)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XO1AzwkPPE&list=PLU8oAlHdN5BmfvwxFO7HdPciOCmmYneAB&index=1), created by [Pildoras Inform√°ticas](https://www.pildorasinformaticas.es).
This first part is an introduction to Django, in which the instructor explains different basic aspects for developing with Django. I took those aspects to learn and create this project. 

Also for implementation I used CSS styles based on the tutorial: [How to make a responsive website / layout with Flexbox CSS3 (in Spanish)](http://www.falconmasters.com/web-design/sitio-web-layout-flexbox/), created by [Carlos Arturo - FalconMasters](https://github.com/falconmasters).
This tutorial had been very useful in my learning of Flexbox in the year 2016, and I took the opportunity to refresh many of the concepts taught there. In addition, I also use [Normalize.css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/).
